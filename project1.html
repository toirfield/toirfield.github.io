						I'm a Senior English Major at <a href="http://www.tamucc.edu/">Texas A&M University Corpus Christi</a>. I'm a creative writer with a particular preference for the fiction and non-fiction genres. The first thing I'll do when I graduate is go to South Korea to teach English.

						I currently work as a preschool teacher at First Baptist Church's Parents' Day Out Program and also as a Pet Specialist at Petco. I recently begun a Parents' Night Out Program at <a href="http://myjourneychurch.co/">Journey Church</a> and will also be leading a Sunday School class for children at 9 A.M.

						I like to stay busy and plan things out. However, the downfall to this is that I get easily stressed out. I've learned that lists are a <em>great</em> stress reliever so you'll never see me without one.
